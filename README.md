# Project info
This project is based on a simple todo list implementation in React by Kumar Shubham. You can find his code on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/shubham1710/React-Todo) and on the
[Medium blog of Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-simple-todo-app-using-react-a492adc9c8a4).

## Changes to the original
We changed some parts of the original code.

Here is a short list of them:
* Created a component for the todo list layout
* Components now have their own files
* Instead of Bootstrap we are using Material UI
* React Hooks now are imported
* The todo list contents now are persistent
* The completion state of a todo is toggleable
* Fixed the key issue of the todo list

# Branch formatting
* camelCase notation for the identifier, e.g. testEdit
* International date format - mmddyyyy, e.g. 06072021
* Contributors please add their username at the end, e.g. testEdit_06072021_anonymous
